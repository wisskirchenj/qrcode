# QR Code app

Implemented in the <b>Introduction to Spring Boot with Java</b> Track of hyperskill.org's JetBrain Academy.<br>

Project goal is to implement a QR-Code app that can produce QR codes â€” 2D barcodes that can store large amounts of data
and are easily read by smartphones. We generate QR Codes programmatically, and integrate them into a web service.
